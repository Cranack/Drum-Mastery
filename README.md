# Drum-Mastery
Drum Mastery is a music software which enables drums players to improve themselves for the double pedal skill, pluging a bass drum pad into the computer.

So far, we are a team of 6 developers, all from the same engineering school : Ecole Centrale de Lille, Lille, France. The former idea comes from a professor of this school, M. Xavier Margueron.
We are all fond of music, which is the driving force of this project.

The software will offer two modes : playing and editing modes.
- The playing mode allow the drum player to train and improve himself on drum sheets. He's able to make a loop to play one sequence as many times as he wants. He's able to see his playing for each loop and compare it to the real sequence. He can know his performance rate.
- The editing mode allow the user to edit his own drum sheet. We want the editing mode to be as ergonomic as possible for the user. For now, it is possible to edit notes from whole note to thirty-second note. We also want to settle a button to automatically fill the sheet with rests. We also want the user to be able to export the sheet in PDF or MusicXML files.

Other features will be developed, as a metronomy, count, or superposition of the sequence to play and the user's playing.

We hope this project will be a success, for the music itself!
