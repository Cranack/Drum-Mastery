# Drum-Mastery
Drum Mastery is a music software which enables drums players to improve themselves for the double pedal skill.

So far, we are a team of 6 developers, all from the same engineering school : Ecole Centrale de Lille, Lille, France. The former idea comes from a professor of this school, M. Xavier Margueron.

The software will offer two modes : playing and editing modes.
- The playing mode will allow the drum player to train and improve himself on drum sheets.
